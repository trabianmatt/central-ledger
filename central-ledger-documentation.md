### Introduction
The Central Ledger offers a series of services to facilitate transfer information for participants. The information collected in the transfer process is leveraged for clearing funds to end users, calculating net positons, and performing net settlements. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through the various steps of completing a transfer.

## Data Structures

### Transfer Object

A transfer represents money being moved between two DFSP accounts at the central ledger.

The transfer must specify an execution_condition, in which case it executes automatically when presented with the fulfillment for the condition. (Assuming the transfer has not expired or been canceled first.) Currently, the central ledger only supports the condition type of [PREIMAGE-SHA-256](https://interledger.org/five-bells-condition/spec.html#rfc.section.4.1) and a max fulfillment length of 65535. 

Some fields are Read-only, meaning they are set by the API and cannot be modified by clients. A transfer object can have the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id   | URI | Resource identifier |
| ledger | URI | The ledger where the transfer will take place |
| debits | Array | Funds that go into the transfer |
| debits[].account | URI | Account holding the funds |
| debits[].amount | String | Amount as decimal |
| debits[].invoice | URI | *Optional* Unique invoice URI |
| debits[].memo | Object | *Optional* Additional information related to the debit |
| debits[].authorized | Boolean | *Optional* Indicates whether the debit has been authorized by the required account holder |
| debits[].rejected | Boolean | *Optional* Indicates whether debit has been rejected by account holder |
| debits[].rejection_message | String | *Optional* Reason the debit was rejected |
| credits | Array | Funds that come out of the transfer |
| credits[].account | URI | Account receiving the funds |
| credits[].amount | String | Amount as decimal |
| credits[].invoice | URI | *Optional* Unique invoice URI |
| credits[].memo | Object | *Optional* Additional information related to the credit |
| credits[].authorized | Boolean | *Optional* Indicates whether the credit has been authorized by the required account holder |
| credits[].rejected | Boolean | *Optional* Indicates whether credit has been rejected by account holder |
| credits[].rejection_message | String | *Optional* Reason the credit was rejected |
| execution_condition | String | The condition for executing the transfer | 
| expires_at | DateTime | Time when the transfer expires. If the transfer has not executed by this time, the transfer is canceled. |
| state | String | *Optional, Read-only* The current state of the transfer (informational only) |
| timeline | Object | *Optional, Read-only* Timeline of the transfer's state transitions |
| timeline.prepared_at | DateTime | *Optional* An informational field added by the ledger to indicate when the transfer was originally prepared |
| timeline.executed_at | DateTime | *Optional* An informational field added by the ledger to indicate when the transfer was originally executed |

### Account Object

An account represents a DFSP's position at the central ledger.

Some fields are Read-only, meaning they are set by the API and cannot be modified by clients. An account object can have the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | URI | *Read-only* Resource identifier |
| name | String | Unique name of the account |
| password | String | Password for the account |
| balance | String | *Optional, Read-only* Balance as decimal |
| is_disabled | Boolean | *Optional, Read-only* Admin users may disable/enable an account |
| ledger | URI | *Optional, Read-only* A link to the account's ledger |
| created | DateTime | *Optional, Read-only* Time when account was created |

### Notification Object

The central ledger pushes a notification object to WebSocket clients when a transfer changes state. This notification is sent at most once for each state change. 

A notification object can have the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| resource | Object | [Transfer object](#transfer-object) that is the subject of the notification |
| related_resources | Object | *Optional* Additional resources relevant to the event |
| related\_resources.execution\_condition_fulfillment | String | *Optional* Proof of condition completion |
| related\_resources.cancellation\_condition_fulfillment | String | *Optional* Proof of condition completion |

### Metadata Object

The central ledger will return a metadata object about itself allowing client's to configure themselves properly.

A metadata object can have the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| currency_code | String | Three-letter ([ISO 4217](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php)) code of the currency this ledger tracks |
| currency_symbol | String | Currency symbol to use in user interfaces for the currency represented in this ledger. For example, "$" |
| ledger | URI | The ledger that generated the metadata |
| urls | Object | Paths to other methods exposed by this ledger. Each field name is short name for a method and the value is the path to that method. |
| precision | Integer | How many total decimal digits of precision this ledger uses to represent currency amounts |
| scale | Integer | How many digits after the decimal place this ledger supports in currency amounts |

### Position Object

The central ledger can report the current positions for all registered accounts.

A position object can have the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| account | URI | A link to the account for the calculated position |
| payments | String | Total non-settled amount the account has paid as string |
| receipts | String | Total non-settled amount the account has received as string |
| net | String | Net non-settled amount for the account as string |

### Charge Object

A charge represents a fee that will be applied on a transfer at execution

A charge object can have the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | Integer | Identifier for the charge |
| name | String | Unique name of the charge |
| charge_type | String | The type of the charge, should be *fee* |
| rate_type | String | The rate type for the charge, either *flat* or *percent* |
| rate | String | The amount for the charge, represented as a *decimal for the percent rate type (5% is 0.05)* and as the *actual value for the flat rate type* |
| minimum | String | Minimum transfer amount for the charge to be applied |
| maximum | String | Maximum transfer amount for the charge to be applied |
| code | String | The letter code used to identify the charge |
| is_active | Boolean | Admin users may activate or deactive the charge |
| payer | String | The account that pays the fee generated by the charge either *sender*, *receiver*, or *ledger* |
| payee | String | The account that receives the fee generated by the charge either *sender*, *receiver*, or *ledger* |
